Week 1:

-   Software Development LifeCycle

    -   Analysis/ Requirement

    -   Design

    -   Implementation

    -   Test/Verification

    -   Maintenance

-   Waterfall Model

    -   Requirement

        -   Design

            -   Implementation

                -   Test

                    -   Maintenance

    -   Do one way, all of Requirement =\> all of Design =\> all of
        Implementation...

    -   If there is a problem in Design, but you are in Implementation,
        you have to go back and redo Design all over again, which is
        expensive

    -   Rigid, sequential application

    -   Each phase is done by a different team

    -   Works okay when problems are discovered early. A stable
        environment

    -   But

        -   Extremely rigid

        -   Can't detect technology problems early

        -   Difficult to plan and schedule

-   Prototyping: Build a small-scale sample of a system

    -   May be functional (or not)

    -   One or two dimension:

        -   Horizontal: lots of features but not deep (minimally
            working)

        -   Vertical design: 1-2 features working completely (16
            features but only 2 actually work)

    -   Give users a chance to see the product

-   Agile procress:

    -   Iterations: Some requirement, some design, some iterations,
        review, go back to design... and do that again and again

    -   More focused, has a prototype along the way

-   Agile Methodology

    -   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: react
        with changes in client's needs

    -   Working software over comprehensive documentation:

    -   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

    -   Response to changes

    -   Iterative and overlapped execution: implementation + testing
        together

-   Non-technical planning artifacts

    -   Initial **vision** for the software:

        -   Describe the purpose of the software

            -   What's going to accomplish

            -   Why is this project valuable

            -   What are success criteria

    -   Set of **features** required to accomplish the vision

        -   Users define capabilities of the software

        -   Something that can be accomplished within one iteration

        -   Participants:

            -   Customers: write feature and assign a priority

            -   Dev: estimate cost time of doing it

    -   Set of **user stories** required to accomplish the feature

        -   As an \[user\] I need to be able to do \[action\]

        -   Include time estimates =\> smaller, more precise

        -   Include priorities
