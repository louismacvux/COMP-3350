# Week 2:

-   Release planning:

    -   Each release is assigned a set of features

    -   Time limited

    -   Release what is done (not necessarily what you planned)

    -   For us: each iteration ends with a release

    -   Goals:

        -   Deliver working software early

        -   Get feedback

        -   Fail fast: fail sooner so there's less work to fix, rather
            than fail latter and fix a lot

-   Architecture: focus on one specific pattern: n-tier architecture

    -   Presentation: UI element (e.g. view a movie)

    -   Business: (e.g. can you view this movie)

    -   Data: things are stored (e.g. get the movie)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Domain specific object (DSO): data passed between layers (e.g.
    movie)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Developer Tasks:

    -   Description of coding task required to build user story

        -   Estimate time in hours

    -   Process:

        -   Brainstorm:

            -   What do I need to do to build this story?

            -   What class do I need to create?

            -   What changes do I need to make to the database?

        -   Estimate

            -   How long is this going to take?

            -   Estimate based on what you know

            -   Time in hours

            -   Task is too large? Split it

        -   Sum

            -   Calculate total cost for all time estimate

            -   Possibly revise the release plan

                -   Move stories to next iteration

                -   Split a story that's too complex
